    <p class="info2">
      Most golfers play a course that is too long for them. Use the calculator to determine what length course you should be playing.
      You typically hit 14 drives per round and you will have 18 approach shots with an iron.
      If you are hitting a wood or long iron into every par 4, it's time to re-assess what tees you play.
