    <p class="info">
      TrakStats is a simple way to track the statistics from your round of golf.  If you have tried to keep track of
      your stats in the past and have failed, look no further!  When you post a score, it will be displayed to other members on the home page.
      You have access to a user dashboard, "My Stats", which lets you look at your stats in-depth.
      Each round you post will be tracked and you can see all of your averages.  Here's a snapshot of what you can track.
