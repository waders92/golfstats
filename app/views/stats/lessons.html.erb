          Wade Carlson has been a PGA professional since 2003. After graduating from MSU's PGA/PGM Program, he went on to serve as the Head Golf Professional
          at Limestone Springs (Oneonta, AL) and The Highlands (Starkville, MS). An expert clubfitter and accomplished teacher, Wade has given over 2000 hours of
          instruction to approximately 125 students.
          <br /><br />
          Wade is a full time Ruby on Rails Developer, but still teaches in his spare time.  If you would like him to take a look at your swing online, click to sign-up for a video lesson. You will
          be prompted to upload a video of your swing (mp4 format).  You can upload a face on view and one from behind or "down the line". Make sure that the club is visible during the entire swing.  Feel free
          to leave some comments about what you struggle with and we can take it from there. Thanks for your interest in TrakStats lessons!
